                        <p> I taught swimming from ages 3-14, went over a curriculum of 6 levels, making sure every
                            student mastered their level and could swim.</p>

                        <h1>Coding Ventures Workshop </h1>
                        <p>Provided incoming high school students with multiple perspectives of the wide field of CS.
                            Organized and taught a 3-week intensive summer workshop on Python, HTML, and CSS topics.
                            Received positive feedback and requests for similar workshops to be held in multiple
                            locations in the city.</p>

                        <h1>Stealth Startup</h1>
                        <p> Worked for 4 months in an online work environment. Made a GUI Library (used to visualize
                            data) compatible with a data engine. Presented updates on library work progress biweekly to
                            the CEO and CTO. Tackled progressively more difficult tasks to build up knowledge and skill
                            sets, which helped me understand the job requirements and to work in a team.</p>

                        <h1>Inspirit AI</h1>
                        <p> Introduced myself to AI and machine learning by researching ethics, models, and neural
                            networks. Experienced hands-on learning with advanced neural network models. After
                            completing initial projects, I was entrusted with the task of of using the neural network
                            model with the goal of contributing to a larger research on driver distractibility.
