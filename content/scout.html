                    <p>
                        Since 2017, I have been a part of the Boy Scouts, a journey that has shaped me in countless
                        ways. On May 2, 2024, I proudly earned the rank of Eagle Scout as a member of Troop 537 in
                        Tracy. Achieving this rank required years of dedication, learning, and service. One of the final
                        and most significant milestones on this path was completing my Eagle Scout Service Project—a
                        project that not only demonstrated my leadership skills but also contributed to my community in
                        a meaningful way.

                        For my project, I chose to construct three picnic tables for Sycamore Grove Park in Livermore,
                        California. These tables were designed with simplicity and durability in mind. Made primarily
                        from redwood, they provide natural weather resistance, eliminating the need for additional
                        sealants or paint. The sturdy construction ensures long-term support for visitors who come to
                        enjoy the park’s serene environment.

                        The process of building these tables involved careful planning and coordination. I used carriage
                        bolts to securely fasten the wooden planks, ensuring stability and longevity. With the
                        assistance of park rangers, the tables were placed in strategic locations along the Arroyo Del
                        Valle Regional Trail, a well-traveled path frequented by both youth and elderly visitors. The
                        exact placement was chosen based on the needs of the park’s beneficiaries, ensuring the best use
                        of these new seating areas.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My project aimed to enhance the park’s infrastructure by providing additional seating for
                        visitors who explore its trails and natural beauty. These tables serve both functional and
                        aesthetic purposes—offering a place for rest, conversation, and appreciation of nature. By
                        creating these picnic tables, I hope to encourage more people to visit, enjoy, and connect with
                        the outdoors in a welcoming and comfortable setting.

                        Reflecting on this experience, I am grateful for the opportunity to lead and contribute to a
                        project that will have a lasting impact. The journey to Eagle Scout has taught me invaluable
                        lessons in leadership, perseverance, and service—qualities that will guide me in all future
                        endeavors.

                        I look forward to continuing to give back to my community and embracing new challenges that push
                        me to grow. Becoming an Eagle Scout is not just an achievement; it is a commitment to lifelong
                        service and leadership.

                    <p>
                        The first step in constructing the picnic tables was gathering all necessary materials. Once the
                        materials were purchased, I started by cutting the 1.5 by 5.5 by 12-foot planks into three
                        groups of four segments, each measuring three feet. These segments would form the legs of each
                        table.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After acquiring all the materials, I sorted them based on type, ensuring I had the correct
                        planks: 2 by 5.5 inches and 2 by 3.5 inches. Next, I prepared the workspace—my garage—by laying
                        down plastic wrapping on the floor. While not strictly necessary, this helped with easier
                        cleanup of wood shavings, which could later be swept or vacuumed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With the workspace ready, I moved on to cutting the corners of the wood pieces designated for
                        the table supports and legs. This step required an electric saw, which was handled only by
                        adults and older volunteers. For younger volunteers, I provided smaller saws for cutting smaller
                        wood pieces, and for those too young to handle tools, I assigned them to cleaning wood shavings
                        and maintaining the worksite.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Once the wood pieces were cut and aligned, I proceeded to drill holes for the carriage bolts and
                        nuts. After verifying that the holes were properly aligned, we sanded all the wood pieces to
                        ensure a smooth finish. Sanding was done by hand using sandpaper, with an automatic sanding
                        machine available for use by older adolescents and adults.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After completing the sanding process, we carefully aligned the wood pieces again and secured
                        them using carriage bolts, washers, and hex nuts. This marked the completion of the first picnic
                        table. The first table served as a blueprint for constructing the remaining two tables, ensuring
                        consistency in measurements and design.

                        Before I could begin constructing the tables, I had to secure the necessary funding and
                        materials. I reached out to Home Depot, which generously provided a donation discount,
                        reducing the project's overall cost. Their support played a
                        role in making this project a reality.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Additionally, I organized coding classes to raise funds for the materials that weren’t covered
                        by donations. Teaching younger students the fundamentals of coding not only helped finance the
                        project but also allowed me to share my passion for technology and education with the community.
                        The classes were a great success, and the funds raised helped cover additional costs like tools,
                        fasteners, and other necessary supplies.
